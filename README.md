# NYC Apartment Inspection Guide

## Introduction

Renting in New York is scary. Between the popular myths (and not-so-myths)
about rats and roaches, absentee landlords, and neighbors with pet crocodiles,
moving here can be pretty daunting. Our goal here is to help keep track of
helpful questions to ask and things to check.

## The Checklist

### The Building / Landlord

This is the most labor-intensive and, honestly, least fun part of the search. I
know, you're seeing pictures, imagining moving in and starting a new life. But
be careful: this is a relationship that will relieve you of 25-50% of your
income. You best make sure your partner is as committed to a working
relationship as you are.

1. Determine the target address
	 * Put the name here:
1. Determine who the landlord is in advance. This is often a limited liability
   company (LLC)
	 * Put their name here:
	 * Check to see what the building's outstanding reports are:
		 * Visit: http://www.nyc.gov/buildings
1. Where applicable, look at the complaints listed
   * Violations: Look at any recent ones. Violations are ECB (Environmental
     Control Board) or DOB (Department of Buildings)
   * Assess:
     * Recency
     * Egregiousness
     * Frequency
     * Repeat
     * Flat-out Shady?
2. Since you now have the landlord entity, visit [ACRIS][] and see if you can
   get a picture of their holdings
   * Multiple properties?
   * In a similar area?
   * Is your unit part of a portfolio for them, or are they small-time (and
     need your rent on-time OR ELSE)?
   * Advanced: If you've decided _against_ a certain landlord, make sure that
     the property you're interested in isn't a shell LLC for the other
     property. Look for duplication of deed holder names.
3. Additional picture of the landlord
   * Visit: https://a836-acris.nyc.gov/CP/LookUp/Index
   * Type in the address to search by address
   * Then click the button "Document search by BBL." This will give you a list
     of lawsuits filed against the building
4. Legal picture of the landlord
   * Search [eCourts][] for lawsuits, play with the names to match the owning
     company etc.
   * This is labor-intensive, but _worth it_!
5.  All this action needs to be taken with a grain of salt. Some tenants are
    lawyer-happy. Some owners are. What you're looking for here is a trend of
    litigiousness or carelessness.
   
   


## The Unit

OK, so the landlord didn't scare you off. Here are some things to check, based
on room.

### General

1. If the unit doesn't have central air (rare), verify windows support AC
   units. Overbuy BTU for AC unit. Have them installed before you move in.
2. Determine trash situation pickup (if slow, on your floor invitation for
   pests). Do you have to recycle in your home? That means additional
   trash-sorting furniture.
3. Try to visit at a noisy time (8:00 am / 5:00-6:00 pm). How much noise comes
   in through the windows in the bedroom? In the area you plan to work?
4. Bring a shout buddy. Have the buddy go down to the sidewalk on the side
   where there is pedestrian traffic or where your bedroom window faces. Have
   them yell "HEY MAN!" How well did you hear it? If well, everyone who yells
   "HEY MAN!" at all hours of the night will be audible to you. Know this
   before you sign anything.

### Windows

1. Check the windows for:
  1. Soundproof-ness
  2. Open / close-ability

### Bathroom

1. Put some pencil shavings or  shredded up toilet paper in the bowl. Flush.
   What was the verdict. If the bowl clears forcefully and completely, great,
   you've got a good one. If the flush is weak or leaves something behind you,
   your guests, your spouse are going to be dealing with that reality. Fix or
   abort.
2. Shower pressure: Forceful? Instant? Hot?

### Kitchen

1. Gas Range:
  1. Check that you can light the stove top easily
  1. Check that you can light the oven easily
  1. Check that you can light the broiler easily
2. Discern the microwave status. If it's not built in, can you bring one in? If
   you need to bring one in, is there a place for it on the counter? If it
   doesn't mount it's going to cost you precious counter real estate
3. What's the ventilation system in the kitchen? If it's "window," this is not
   ideal. See if the LL will install a ventilation fan for you. If you are
   going to make do with "window," make sure that it's easily accessible for
   opening and closing. Also realize that many windows are above ranges, so if
   you have something on the range and need to open the window, you're out of
   luck. If "window" is the ventilation system, greasy vapor will collect on
   your ceiling and will collect on cabinets / cupboards and you will need to
   clean it regularly. Given the space constraints these spaces often have
   seasonal bakeware. You will have to degrease them on each use.

## Guidelines

1. TRADE TIME FOR REPAIR: once you're in it'll never get fixed. Agree on a todo
   list and agree that you will not move in until that list is done to your
   satisfaction. Even if you have to pay a higher up priced month to month at
   current place, get your new place READY before you go
2. Trade money for a good, regular house cleaner (word of mouth is best)
